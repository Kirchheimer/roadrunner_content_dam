Non-compliance can result in lawsuits, steep fines, and damage to your brand reputation. Organizations across industries—from retail to healthcare to education—must ensure their digital properties are accessible to all users.\n\nThe Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) applies to websites, and enforcement actions are increasing rapidly. Don't wait until you receive a demand letter or face legal action."
