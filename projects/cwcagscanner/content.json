          "question": "Is the free scan really free?",
          "answer": "Yes, absolutely. You can scan any website up to 10 pages completely free with no credit card required. You'll receive a full accessibility report showing all detected issues with detailed remediation guidance. This gives you a clear picture of your current compliance status before deciding on a paid plan."
        },
        {
          "question": "How accurate is automated accessibility testing?",
          "answer": "Automated testing reliably catches 70-80% of WCAG violations, including all issues that can be detected programmatically—missing alt text, insufficient color contrast, keyboard accessibility problems, and more. For complete assurance, we recommend combining automated scans with our expert manual audit services, which identify issues requiring human judgment."
        },
        {
          "question": "What happens if my site goes out of compliance after I fix everything?",
          "answer": "That's exactly why we built continuous monitoring. Your site changes constantly—new content, design updates, third-party integrations. Our platform automatically rescans your site on your chosen schedule (daily, weekly, or monthly) and immediately alerts you to any new violations, so you can fix them before they become legal problems."
        },
        {
          "question": "Do you support non-English websites?",
          "answer": "Yes. WCAG Scanner tests websites in any language. Accessibility requirements are largely language-independent—color contrast, keyboard navigation, alt text presence, and structural elements all function the same way regardless of content language. Our reports can be generated in multiple languages for international teams."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I use this for client websites if I'm an agency?",
          "answer": "Absolutely. Our agency plans include white-label reporting, bulk scanning capabilities, and client management features. Scan multiple client sites from a single dashboard, generate branded reports, and offer accessibility monitoring as a value-added service. Many agencies use WCAG Scanner as a core part of their service offerings."
        },
        {
          "question": "What level of WCAG compliance do I need?",
          "answer": "Most organizations should target WCAG 2.1 Level AA, which is the standard referenced in ADA cases and federal regulations. This provides strong accessibility for users with disabilities while remaining achievable for most websites. Level AAA is optional and recommended only for specialized applications. We'll help you determine the right compliance level for your specific situation."
